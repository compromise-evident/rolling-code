Version 3.1.0   Thorough swapping in  randomness[].  Every element  is affected.
                This was the original plan but slow, but tested on faster PCs...
                Ready to be standard in all my rand-using repos.  200kB/s codes.

Version 3.0.2   RAM_Unix_time_supplement  creates  100  10-digit values from RAM
                garbage & Unix time then adds them to 100 10-digit actual_seeds.

Version 3.0.1   Option to generate randomness,  rather than dependent  on seeds.
                See bool RAM_Unix_time_supplement. Other.RAM overwriting. Clean.

Version 3.0.0   Complete rewrite. Fixed symm. Main improvement: random swapping;
                order matters, not just  substance. Speedy. 1,000-char segments.

Version 2.0.1   Universal drag-n-drop; gets path then fixes it if drag-n-dropped
                regardless of single-quote presence & "enter" not being cleared,
                meaning you can have options before it where user presses enter.

Version 2.0.0   Major security addition: secondary_seeds[].  Not compat w/ prev.
                This means you must  assume  what the  entire string looks like,
                before you can test it (cryptanalyze.) ...The first char depends
                on the last, the last on the first, and so on--all throughout as
                done in Authorship, AuthorshipFemto, Hypership...

Version 1.0.0   Secure rc system hence slow.
