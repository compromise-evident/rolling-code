Version 2.0.1   Universal drag-n-drop; gets path then fixes it if drag-n-dropped
                regardless of single-quote presence & "enter" not being cleared,
                meaning you can have options before it where user presses enter.

Version 2.0.0   Major security addition: secondary_seeds[].  Not compat w/ prev.
                This means you must  assume  what the  entire string looks like,
                before you can test it (cryptanalyze.) ...The first char depends
                on the last, the last on the first, and so on--all throughout as
                done in Authorship, AuthorshipFemto, Hypership...
